Project Description

The present project is entitled, Change The Future, a project aiming to accomplish an arduous task to change the future. With the recent events revolving Climate Change and Global Warming--and the prominent effects of it, from climate to the environment--this project aims to bring more awareness through a dynamic website. This dynamic website, appropriately named CTF or Change the Future, will consist of information regarding the cause and effect, what steps have been taken so far by different countries about the previously mentioned global problems, as well as include advocacies, projects and petitions--forms for anyone to sign and join for a great cause. Alongside many informative bodies of text are images to showcase the problem at hand. All of this will be accomplished through the use of various developmental languages and frameworks, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular, etc.
